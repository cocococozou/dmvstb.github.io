With an average following-up period of `r mean(df$days)/365` year (range: `r min(df$days)/365` to `r max(df$days)/365` years, `r sum(df$tb)` TB cases were recorded among `r nrow(df)` T2DM patients from `r sum(df$days)/365` person-years follow-up. The overall incident rate of TB was `r 100000*(sum(df$tb)/(sum(df$days)/365))` per 100 000 person-years with `r 100000*(sum(df_male$tb)/(sum(df_male$days)/365))` per 100 000 person-years for men, and `r 100000*(sum(df_female$tb)/(sum(df_female$days)/365))` per 100 000 person-years for women.
