Motivation
----------

Due to rapid urbanizations and lifestyles, type 2 diabetes (T2D) has become one of the most concerning public health issues in China. People with T2D are at risk of multiple complications including blindness, cardiovascular diseases, and becoming more susceptible to infectious diseases. As a result, researchers began to notice a higher tuberculosis (TB) incidence in the T2D positive population. Therefore, we would like to explore the association between TB and T2D and what potential risk factors contribute to this comorbidity, and hopefully, provide recommendations to control or decrease the prevalence of T2D and TB in China.

Data Source and Predicted Final Product
---------------------------------------

Based on the data set, we plan to contain the association between TB developing in T2D patients and diagnosis time, BMI, complications, medicine, exercises and other factors in the final products.

The diabetes data is from Shanghai community-based diabetes management system (SCDMS) and Tuberculosis data is from Shanghai Municipal TB Surveillance System (SMTSS). The planned analyses include examining the incident rate of tuberculosis (TB) and its associates among adults with type 2 diabetes in Shanghai, China between 2004-2014, and geographical distribution of TB infection among these specific populations. We intend to explore which variables might affect the TB incidence in people with type 2 diabetes. The potential factors would conclude gender, sociodemographic factor (i.e. age at diagnosis of T2D), clinical parameters (BMI, fasting glucose), complications of T2D, choice of antidiabetic medication, mode of exercises and geographical location.

We may present tables to list key variables, use boxplots to compare the mean difference in different group of people, scatter plots to show the relationship between different variables and geographical location to display the patients’ agglomeration mode. We can also go further to explore how to apply some formal statistical test and model (Kaplan–Meier survival curves, log-rank test and Cox regression) in R and make some plots.
