>###Introduction

Diabetes mellitus (DM) has been emerging as the most urgent global challenge. People with diabetes are at increased risks of developing a number of health problems, including serious damage of heart and blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, nerves and teeth, and confer a higher risk for developing infections, among which, mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection is a major one.TB remerges as one of the significant communicable diseases worldwide. In 2013, about 9 million people fell ill with TB and 1.5 million died from this disease globally. The comorbidity of these two diseases presents an eminent threat to global public health, in particular, among major developing countries. The dual burden of TB and DM has attracted much attention in the past decade as DM prevalence has increased dramatically worldwide.

Chinese account for a quarter of all diabetic patients worldwide and every one out of 10 Chinese adults are with diabetes, and the prevalence of diabetes among adults in China is climbing without any sign of stopping in a foreseeable future. On the other hand, studies in the developed countries demonstrated that population attributable fraction of diabetes for pulmonary TB was higher for Asian population in comparison to other ethnicities.The heavy burden of TB and DM among Chinese population and a high comorbidity between TB and DM among Asian population call for an extensive effort to investigate the unique comorbidity between TB and DM among Chinese. 
    
As diabetes has been considered as a significant risk factor of TB, Shanghai meets a great challenge in controlling and preventing tuberculosis since climbing incidence of diabetes. Thus, the care and control of tuberculosis among diabetes patient should be highlighted in the process of implementing the END TB Strategy launched by WHO.
    
Therefore, we gain accessible to this DM database to do some analysis. The specific aim of this study was to assess the risk of developing TB among adults with diabetes. We also evaluated the factors associated with an increased risk of TB, including body mass index (BMI), DM complications, medication status and lifestyle among adults with diabetes.

>###Data Sources

The data used were from Shanghai community-based diabetes management system (SCDMS), a diabetes register system operated by the Shanghai Municipal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The health bureau requires Shanghai Municipal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to enroll more than 25% of confirmed DM cases in Shanghai in SCDMS. These cases identified through the following approaches: community-based DM screenings, routine physical examinations and self-reporting. Regardless of how the DM cases were identified, physicians in Community Health Centers (CHCs) using 1999 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria to verify diagnosis before cases being registered. For confirmed DM cases, in-person interviews were conducted every 3 months after the initial assessment by CHC physicians to collect data on physical examination (including BMI and fasting blood glucose), complications, treatment modalities (categories and forms of medications used), lifestyle factors (including duration and intensity of physical activity in leisure time). 

This data also contains some variables from Shanghai Municipal TB Surveillance System (SMTSS), a mandatory TB reporting system managed by all CDCs at city and district level in Shanghai and thus we were able to trace DM participantsâ€™ TB status.

>###Statistical analyses
   
We explore some variables including drugs, the age of diagnosis of diabetes, BMI and glucose, stratified by gender and geographical areas. Make some discription of distribution of these variables among tuberculosis cases and non-tuberculosis cases.

For patients with TB, follow-up assessments were limited with the period ending with the time when TB diagnosis was confirmed. For non-TB patients, follow-up assessments were extended to the end of study, i.e. December 31, 2014, unless missing or death occurred. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for TB infection were obtained to check the difference between male and female.

Person-years contributed by each participant were calculated as the interval between the date of initial assessment and the date of TB diagnosis or last follow-up interview. Estimates of the crude and the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of being diagnosed with TB were derived from Cox proportional hazard regression models for individuals with different level of risk factors. The proportional hazards assumption was checked by visual inspection of plots of log [-log (S)] against time, where S was the estimated survival function. 

As the literatures repeatedly demonstrated a sex difference in risk factors of TB incident rate,we stratified our analysis by sex. All analyses were performed using R software.

>###Main Results

With an average following-up period of 3.8 year (range: 0 to 10.96 years), 785 TB cases were recorded among 170 381 T2DM patients from 654 977 person-years follow-up. The incident rate of TB was 168.29 per 100 000 person-years for men, and 38.54 per 100 000 person-years for women. 
     
There was a clear separation of Kaplan-Meier survival curves, men had a higher probability of being attacked by TB compared with women. The separation started from the beginning of the follow-up, and the diverging trend accelerated at the third year of the follow-up. 
     
For each district in Shanghai, we calculate the incidence of TB, estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio for having TB comparing diabetes who regularly monitor glucose to those who don't monitor glucose regularly keeping all other variables fixed. We also obtain odds ratio in different level of drugs.
