### Download data

```{r}
load('./data/df_combine.Rdata')
```


### Incidence

```{r}
df_exercise = df_combine %>% 
  mutate(exercise = as.numeric(exercise),
         total_exercise = exercise * exercise_time,
         gender = as.factor(gender))
```


```{r}
df_incidence  <- df_exercise %>% 
  mutate(tb = fct_recode(tb, '1'= 'Yes', '0'='No')) %>% 
  mutate(tb=as.character(tb),
         tb=as.numeric(tb)) %>% 
  group_by(total_exercise) %>% 
  summarise(tb_sum = sum(tb),
           incidence = tb_sum/n()) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

### K-M plot for different exercise people

```{r}
df_exercise = df_exercise %>% 
  inner_join(df_incidence, by = "total_exercise")

df_exercise$survival = with(df_exercise, Surv(days, tb == "Yes"))

km <- survfit(survival ~ 1, data = df_exercise, conf.type = "log-log")
km_by_exercise <- survfit(survival ~ exercise, data = df_exercise, conf.type = "log-log")

km_by_exercise_time <- survfit(survival ~ exercise_time, data = df_exercise, conf.type = "log-log")

plot_exercise_level <- GGally::ggsurv(km_by_exercise, main = "Kaplan-Meier Curve for getting TB of different exercise level")
plotly::ggplotly(plot_exercise_level)

plot_exercise_time <- GGally::ggsurv(km_by_exercise_time, main = "Kaplan-Meier Curve for getting TB of different exercise time")
plotly::ggplotly(plot_exercise_time)
```

The plot shows that people with lower exercise level have higher probability of getting TB, which show that exercise is important to preventing TB. However, people with over 2 hours exercise time have higher probability of getting TB. That may be because that people spending more time on exercise have more probability touching other people and getting infection.


### Show exercise difference between gender


```{r}
plot_exer<-ggplot(df_exercise, aes(x = dmage, y =total_exercise, colour=dmage)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "identity", width = .6) +
    labs(title="The average exercise vs age",
         x = "age") +
    theme(axis.title.x =  element_blank(),
          axis.text.x  =  element_blank(), 
          axis.title.y = element_text(face="bold", size=12),
          axis.text.y  = element_text(angle=0, vjust=0.5, size=10),
          legend.title = element_text(size=12, face="bold"),
          legend.text = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"))+
    facet_wrap(~gender)
ggplotly(plot_exer)
```


Average exercise of female is slightly higher than male.

### map


```{r}

  group_by(district) %>% 
  summarise(exercise_sum = sum(total_exercise)) %>% 
  ungroup()

levels(x$district) <- list("Huangpu" = 310101, "Xuhui" = 310104, "Changning" = c(310105, 310106), "Putuo" = 310107, "Zhabei" = 310108, "Hongkou" = 310109, "Yangpu" = 310110, "Minhang" = 310112, "Baoshan" = 310113,  "Pudong" = c(310115, 310119), "Jiading" = 310114, "Jinshan" = 310116, "Songjiang" = 310117, "Qingpu" = 310118, "Fengxian" = 310120, "Chongming" = 310230)
```

```{r}

```

```{r}

qtm(sh, fill = "exercise_sum")
```

People from Minxing district has the highest exercise.
