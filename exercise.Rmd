### K-M plot for different exercise people

```{r, message=F, warning=F, echo=F}
df_exercise = df_exercise %>% 
  inner_join(df_incidence, by = "total_exercise")

df_exercise$survival = with(df_exercise, Surv(days, tb == "Yes"))

km <- survfit(survival ~ 1, data = df_exercise, conf.type = "log-log")
km_by_exercise <- survfit(survival ~ exercise, data = df_exercise, conf.type = "log-log")

km_by_exercise_time <- survfit(survival ~ exercise_time, data = df_exercise, conf.type = "log-log")

plot_exercise_level <- GGally::ggsurv(km_by_exercise, main = "Kaplan-Meier Curve for getting TB of different exercise level")
plotly::ggplotly(plot_exercise_level)

plot_exercise_time <- GGally::ggsurv(km_by_exercise_time, main = "Kaplan-Meier Curve for getting TB of different exercise time")
plotly::ggplotly(plot_exercise_time)
```

The plot shows that people with lower exercise level have higher probability of getting TB, which show that exercise is important to preventing TB. However, people with over 2 hours exercise time have higher probability of getting TB. That may be because that people spending more time on exercise have more probability touching other people and getting infection.


### Show exercise difference among gender and age


```{r, message=F, warning=F, echo=F}
df_exercise$urban_rural <- ifelse(df_exercise$urban_rural== 1, "Urban", "Rural")

plot_exer = df_exercise %>% 
  group_by(gender, urban_rural, dmage) %>% 
  summarize(total_exercise = mean(total_exercise)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = dmage, y =total_exercise, color=urban_rural)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(title="The average exercise vs age",
         x = "Age",
         y = "Exercise")+
  theme_classic() 

ggplotly(plot_exer) 


box_exercise = df_exercise %>% 
  mutate(mean_exercise = mean(total_exercise)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = bmi_average, fill = tb)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(10, 40)) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title="The average exercise vs gender and tb",
         x = "Gender",
         y = "Average Exercise") 

ggplotly(box_exercise)
```


Average exercise of female is slightly higher than male.

People from Minxing district has the highest exercise.
